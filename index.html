            <div class="pair">
                <h5>When does hurricane season start?</h5>
                <p>Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1st, running through November 30th. On average, 12 storm systems are produced with 6 becoming hurricanes and 2 out of the 6 are categorized as 3 or higher. Peak hurricane production is mid-August to late October, though a devastating storm can happen at any given time during the season.</p>
              </div>
            <div class="pair">
              <h5>What is the difference between a hurricane watch and a hurricane warning?</h5>
              <p>When a hurricane is approaching land, a watch or warning is issued to the predicted impacted areas. A watch is issued if hurricane conditions are predicted to occur on a landmass within 24-36 hours. A warning is issued if hurricane conditions are predicted to occur on a landmass within 24 hours. These are officially issued by the National Hurricane Center.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pair">
              <h5>What is the “eye” of a hurricane?</h5>
              <p>The "eye" is a roughly circular area of  light winds and fair weather found at the center of a severe tropical cyclone. Although the winds are calm at the axis of rotation, strong winds may extend well into the eye. There is little or no precipitation and sometimes the sky can be seen. The eye is the region of lowest surface pressure and warmest temperatures aloft.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pair">
              <h5>What is the “eyewall”?</h5>
              <p>The eye is surrounded by the "eyewall", the roughly circular ring of deep convection which is the area of highest surface winds in the tropical cyclone. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <div class="pair">
              <h5>What is storm surge and how is it different from storm tide?</h5>
              <p>Storm Surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tide. <b>Storm Tide</b> is the water level rise during a storm due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide.</p>
            </div>
    				<div class="pair">
    					<h5>How and why are tropical cyclones named?</h5>
    					<p>Tropical cyclones are named to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts, watches, and warnings. Since the storms can often last a week or longer and that more than one can be occurring in the same basin at the same time, names can reduce the confusion about what storm is being described.</p>
    				</div>
            <div class="pair">
              <h5>Does climate change affect hurricane season?</h5>
              <p>Climate change does not directly cause hurricanes, but it does affect the power behind one. As a result of climate change, tropical waters and the atmosphere can be warmer during hurricane season, thus affecting the amount rainfall during a hurricane due to more moisture being collected.</p>
