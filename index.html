    					<h3>Does climate change affect hurricane season?</h3>
    					<p>Climate change does not directly cause hurricanes, but it does affect the power behind one. As a result of climate change, tropical waters and the atmosphere can be warmer during hurricane season, thus affecting the amount rainfall during a hurricane due to more moisture being collected.</p>

              <h3>What is the “eye” of a hurricane?</h3>
              <p>The "eye" is a roughly circular area of  light winds and fair weather found at the center of a severe tropical cyclone. Although the winds are calm at the axis of rotation, strong winds may extend well into the eye. There is little or no precipitation and sometimes the sky can be seen. The eye is the region of lowest surface pressure and warmest temperatures aloft.</p>

              <h3>What is storm surge and how is it different from storm tide?</h3>
              <p>Storm Surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm, over and above the predicted astronomical tide. <b>Storm Tide</b> is the water level rise during a storm due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide.</p>
            </div>
    				<div class="pair">
    					<h3> What is the “eyewall”?</h3>
    					<p>The eye is surrounded by the "eyewall", the roughly circular ring of deep convection which is the area of highest surface winds in the tropical cyclone. </p>
