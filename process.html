                <h2>A quick look behind project hurakan.</h2><br>
                <p class="one description">Hurakan is a two component, educational project over Atlantic hurricanes. This project aims to showcase the damaging effects of Category 1,3, and 5 hurricanes through virtual reality while also providing a starting point for information
                    for those located in hurricane prone areas through the project website.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>01. Project Description</h2><br>
                <p class="one description">After working with many different technologies over our college career, for our senior project we wanted to look at ways to help people in our community with the skills that we've learned. With us all living in Texas and experiencing hurricanes
                    all the time, we tend to get complacent with them and either not evacuate or properly prepare for them. So we wanted to help ourselves and other people relearn and remind them of the importance of hurricane preparedness. We did that
                    in two parts: 1) this website that's filled with educational information and 2) a virtual reality experience that takes a look at the destructive properties of hurricanes. With this website, we found that while there are tons with
                    websites with amazing information on hurricanes, they tend to be overwhelming and confusing to navigate. We wanted to create something that a person with little knowledge on the subject can explore and learn the basics without having
                    to dig. We wanted to split up the site into how to prepare, endure, and recover from hurricanes because we found that many websites focused solely on preparedness and rarely talk about what to do after. We also started this project
                    wanting to incorporate VR but also making it more accessible to people to don't have a VR headset. So having an informational website with the option of playing the VR experience on the browser was a good balance.
                </p>

                <p class="one description"><b>Nancy</b> is a senior AET (Arts and Entertainment Technologies) student behind this website. She designed and coded this website from scratch and published the documentation of the project.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Henry</b> is a senior AET game development student heading the virtual reality application. Through this project, Henry was able to further mature his skills in virtual reality and apply his game dev skills in an educational setting.

                <h2>03. The Process</h2><br>
                <p class="one description">Below are images of the early iterations of the website and pictures of our first round of playtesting the VR experience. We first designed the website in Figma to get a general layout and feel.</p>
                <img src="assets/textweb1.png" width="100%">
                <img src="assets/testweb2.png" width="100%">
                <p class="one description">Then we did a rough layout in code with majority placeholder text and images.</p>
                <img src="assets/1.png" width="100%">
                <img src="assets/2.png" width="100%">
                <p class="one description">Over the course of the project the VR Room had many revisions. We sketched and prototyped the layout and direction of the VR experience.</p>
                <img src="assets/testVR.png" width="80%">
                <p class="one description">The first iteration of our VR project revolved around the idea of having a separate VR room from a gallery that would hold videos and posters. We later got of rid this design for a fusion of a gallery and VR room to be one cohesive area.</p>
                <img src="assets/VR-Room-Iteration-1.png" width="100%">
                <p class="one description">The second iteration of our project consists of the user being inside a house. In this house, the user would be able to see the 3 different levels of a storm happening outside of three separate windows. But due to inefficient use of the
                    house space, the window’s small size, and lack of direction, the storms weren’t being showcased effectively and we later moved on from this design. It was at this stage where most of the hurricane storm effects were added in. Basic
                    teleporting movement in VR were also added put in place at this phase.</p>
                <img src="assets/VR-Room-Iteration-2.png" width="100%">
                <p class="one description">This was the third iteration where we got rid of the house idea for a single corridor layout. This layout was used to help show the progression of ferocity and power of the storms as you go down the hall. This iteration was also the start
                    for creating the VR interactions into the project. The effects of the hurricane were finalized at this point.</p>
                <img src="assets/VR-Room-Iteration-3.png" width="100%">
                <p class="one description">This is the final design of the project where we went with an exhibit idea tacked on to the hallway idea. The user would come out of a hall and learn to interact with the VR rooms via podiums. The windows were made much larger to accommodate
                    for different user heights in VR. All of the things we wanted in VR were in place. The videos, posters and effects were integrated together and all the VR aspects were finished. This is the final build we went with.</p>
                <img src="assets/VR-Room-Iteration-Final.png" width="100%">

                <p class="one description">Below are images of our first round of playtesting the VR experience.</p>

                <p class="one description">The Mac and Windows builds can be downloaded and played on your own computer. There are files for both VR and non-VR to accommodate anyone that doesn't have access to a VR headset. Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xLyrd8h0cIDO9WYW7msaWV69WjWVWGN9"

                <h2>05. Future Applications</h2><br>
                <p class="one description">We hope hurricane prone peoples will use Hurakan as a starting point for hurricane preparedness. With further development, Hurakan VR will be available to download for people to explore on their own, could hold the potential to be used
                    as an educational tool in schools, and used in other hurricane preparedness related settings. </p>
