                <h2>A quick look behind project hurakan.</h2><br>
                <p class="one description">Hurakan is a two component, educational project over Atlantic hurricanes. This project aims to showcase the damaging effects of Category 1,3, and 5 hurricanes through virtual reality while also providing a starting point for information
                    for those located in hurricane prone areas through the project website.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>01. Project Description</h2><br>
                <p class="one description">After working with many different technologies over our college career, for our senior project we wanted to look at ways to help people in our community with the skills that we've learned. With us all living in Texas and experiencing hurricanes
                    all the time, we tend to get complacent with them and either not evacuate or properly prepare for them. So we wanted to help ourselves and other people relearn and remind them of the importance of hurricane preparedness. We did that
                    in two parts: 1) this website that's filled with educational information and 2) a virtual reality experience that takes a look at the destructive properties of hurricanes. With this website, we found that while there are tons with
                    websites with amazing information on hurricanes, they tend to be overwhelming and confusing to navigate. We wanted to create something that a person with little knowledge on the subject can explore and learn the basics without having
                    to dig. We wanted to split up the site into how to prepare, endure, and recover from hurricanes because we found that many websites focused solely on preparedness and rarely talk about what to do after. We also started this project
                    wanting to incorporate VR but also making it more accessible to people to don't have a VR headset. So having an informational website with the option of playing the VR experience on the browser was a good balance.
                </p>

                <h2>02. The Team</h2><br>
                <p class="one description"><b>Nancy</b> is a senior AET (Arts and Entertainment Technologies) student behind this website. She designed and coded this website from scratch and published the documentation of the project.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Henry</b> is a senior AET game development student heading the virtual reality application. Through this project, Henry was able to further mature his skills in virtual reality and apply his game dev skills in an educational setting.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Annabelle</b> is a senior AET student acting as project manager and content creator for Hurakan. Annabelle is responsible for the curation of information and graphic content for the project.

                <p class="one description">Below are images of the early iterations of the website and pictures of our first round of playtesting the VR experience. We first designed the website in Figma to get a general layout and feel.</p>

                <img src="assets/testweb2.png" width="100%">
                <p class="one description">Then we did a rough layout in code with majority placeholder text and images.</p>

                <img src="assets/2.png" width="100%">
                <p class="one description">We also sketched and prototype the layout and direction of the VR experience.</p>

                <h2>04. Future Applications</h2><br>
                <p class="one description">We hope hurricane prone peoples will use Hurakan as a starting point for hurricane preparedness. With further development, Hurakan VR will be available to download for people to explore on their own, could hold the potential to be used
                    as an educational tool in schools, and used in other hurricane preparedness related settings. </p>
